**CSE 501N Programming Concepts and Practice(Test out)**

An introduction to software concepts and implementation, emphasizing problem solving through abstraction and decomposition. Introduces processes and algorithms, procedural abstraction, data abstraction, encapsulation, and object-oriented programming. Recursion, iteration, and simple data structures are covered. Concepts and skills are mastered through programming projects, many of which employ graphics to enhance conceptual understanding. Java, an object-oriented programming language, is the vehicle of exploration. Active-learning sessions are conducted in a studio setting in which students interact with each other and the professor to solve problems collaboratively. 


**CSE 502N Data Structures and Algorithms**

Study of fundamental algorithms, data structures, and their effective use in a variety of applications. Emphasizes importance of data structure choice and implementation for obtaining the most efficient algorithm for solving a given problem. A key component of this course is worst-case asymptotic analysis, which provides a quick and simple method for determining the scalability and effectiveness of an algorithm.


**CSE 427S Cloud Computing with Big Data Applications**

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to applied parallel computing using the MapReduce programming model facilitating large scale data management and processing. There will be an emphasis on hands-on experience working with the Hadoop architecture, an open-source software framework written in Java for distributed storage and processing of very large data sets on computer clusters. Further, we will derive and discuss various algorithms to tackle big data applications and make use of related big data analysis tools from the Hadoop ecosystem, such as Pig, Hive, Impala, and Apache Spark to solve problems faced by enterprises today.


**CSE 503S Rapid Prototype Development and Creative Programming**

This course uses web development as a vehicle for developing skills in rapid prototyping. Students acquire the skills to build a Linux web server in Apache, to write a web site from scratch in PHP, to run an SQL database, to perform scripting in Python, to employ the AngularJS web framework, and to develop modern web applications in client-side and server-side JavaScript. The course culminates with a creative project in which students are able to synthesize the course material into a project of their own interest. The course implements an interactive studio format: after a formal presentation of a topic, students develop a related project under the supervision of the instructor. 330S and 503S share the same lecture. Students who opt for the 503S version will be expected to complete more work, commensurate with the graduate-level course number. 


**CSE 438S Mobile Application Development**

Learn how to create iOS apps in the Swift programming language. This course covers a variety of topics in the development of modern mobile applications, with a focus on hands-on projects. Students will create multiple fully-functional apps from scratch. The course emphasizes object-oriented design patterns and real-world development techniques. Time is provided at the end of the course for students to work on a project of their own interest.


**CSE 514A Data Mining**

Mining a large amount of data through data mining has become an effective means to extracting knowledge from data. This course introduces the basic concepts and methods for data mining and provides hands-on experience for processing, analyzing and modeling structured and unstructured data. Homework problems, examines and programming assignments will be administrated throughout the course to enhance the learning.



In progress:

**CSE 530S Database Management Systems**

A study of data models and the database management systems that support these data models. The design theory for databases is developed and various tools are utilized to apply the theory. General query languages are studied and techniques for query optimization are investigated. Integrity and security requirements are studied in the context of concurrent operations on a database, where the database may be distributed over one or more locations. The unique requirements for engineering design databases, image databases, and long transaction systems are analyzed. 


**CSE 541T Advanced Algorithms**

Provides a broad coverage of fundamental algorithm design techniques with the focus on developing efficient algorithms for solving combinatorial and optimization problems. The topics covered include: greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, linear programming, NP-completeness, approximation algorithms, lower bound techniques, and on-line algorithms. Throughout this course there is an emphasis on correctness proofs and the ability to apply the techniques taught to design efficient algorithms for problems from a wide variety of application areas.
